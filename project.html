                <p>This is a food giving website which i design on XD and I did logo on AI, as you can see I used the appropraite images
                    that align with the giving, used to design this website we use the color palette of light green, wine, black, and grey to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. Light green can represent growth, freshness, and positivity, which can convey the message of hope and renewal that aligns with the idea "feeding the nation." Wine can evoke feelings of warmth, compassion, and support, which can connect with the emotional aspect of helping people. Black and grey can be used for text, accents, and backgrounds to create contrast and balance. 

                    And we make use a white space, also known as negative space, can help create a clean and organized layout. Sufficient spacing between elements, such as text, images, and buttons, can improve readability and allow the content to breathe. It also helps to create a sense of visual hierarchy and directs the user's attention to important elements. 
                    And the user flow is designed with the goal of guiding users towards the desired actions, such as making donations, getting involved, or contacting the organization.
